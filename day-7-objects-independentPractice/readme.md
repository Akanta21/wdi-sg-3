## Independent Monkey Exercise (20 minutes)

- Create a `monkey` object, which has the following properties:

  - `name`
  - `species`
  - `foodsEaten`

  And the following methods:

  - `eatSomething(thingAsString)`
  - `introduce`: producers a string introducing itself, including its name, species, and what it's eaten

- Create 3 monkeys total. Make sure all 3 monkeys have all properties set and methods defined.

- Exercise your monkeys by retrieving their properties and using their methods. Practice using both syntaxes for retrieving properties (dot notation and brackets).

## Conclusion

We will use objects in JavaScript every day, and you will have plenty of time to practice creating and using objects in Javascript. There are a lot of resources available on the web for you to dive deeper, but the most detailed and understandable one is probably MDN.
