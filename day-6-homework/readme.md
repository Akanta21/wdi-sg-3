#Javascript Mini Project - Tic Tac Toe

We're going to build Tic Tac Toe BUT we're not going to have a UI, in fact we're going to do it using some TDD principles.


0. Brush up on the Rules of Tic-Tac-Toe (often called Noughts & Crosses)
0. We will need a 3x3 grid, this is best represented as a simple (one-dimensional) array.
0. You will have two players, who will each take turns to place a __O__ or an __X__ on our grid.
0. Use logic to calculate the winner of a game.
